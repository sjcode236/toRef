üôè GUARDIAN ANGEL PRAYER   
Angel of God, my guardian dear,
OUR FATHER
Our Father, who art in heaven,

hallowed be thy name;

thy kingdom come,

thy will be done

on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread,

and forgive us our trespasses,

as we forgive those who trespass against us;

and lead us not into temptation,

but deliver us from evil.

Amen.



HAIL MARY    
Hail, Mary, full of grace,

the Lord is with thee.

Blessed art thou among women

and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God,

pray for us sinners,

now and at the hour of our death.

Amen.


CONFITEOR (I Confess)     
I Confess to Almighty God,

and to you, my brothers and sisters,

that I have sinned through my own fault,

in my thoughts and in my words,

in what I have done, and in what I have failed to do.

And I ask blessed Mary, ever Virgin, all the angels and saints and

you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord, Our God.




ACT OF CONTRITION    
My God,

I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.

In choosing to do wrong

and failing to do good,

I have sinned against you

whom I should love above all things.

I firmly intend, with your help,

to do penance, to sin no more,

and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.

Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.

In His name, my God, have mercy.


to whom God‚Äôs love commits me here,

ever this day be at my side,

to light and guard, to rule and guide.

Amen.

GRACE BEFORE MEALS     
Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts,

which we are about to receive from Thy bounty,

through Christ our Lord.

Amen.   

MEMORARE
Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,

that never was it known that

anyone who fled to thy protection,

implored thy help, or sought thy intercession,

was left unaided.

Inspired by this confidence I fly unto thee,

O Virgin of virgins, my Mother.

To thee do I come, before thee I stand,

sinful and sorrowful.

O Mother of the Word Incarnate,

despise not my petitions,

but in thy mercy hear and answer me.

Amen.



SALVE REGINA (Hail Holy Queen)
Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,

our life, our sweetness and our hope.

To thee do we cry,

poor banished children of Eve.

To thee do we send up our sighs,

mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.

Turn then, most gracious advocate,

thine eyes of mercy toward us,

and after this our exile

show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

O clement, O loving,

O sweet Virgin Mary.




ANGELUS
V. The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary,

R. And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.

Hail Mary‚Ä¶

V. Behold the handmaid of the Lord,

R. Be it done unto me according to your Word.

Hail Mary‚Ä¶

V. And the Word was made flesh,

R. And dwelt among us.

Hail Mary‚Ä¶

V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God,

R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.


Pour forth, we beseech you, O Lord,

your grace into our hearts: that we,

to whom the Incarnation of Christ your Son

was made known by the message of an Angel,

may by His Passion and Cross

be brought to the glory of his Resurrection.

Through the same Christ our Lord.

Amen.


        


THE APOSTLES‚Äô CREED
I believe in God,

the Father almighty,

Creator of heaven and earth,

and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,

who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,

born of the Virgin Mary,

suffered under Pontius Pilate,

was crucified, died and was buried;

he descended into hell;

on the third day he rose again from the dead;

he ascended into heaven,

and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;

from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,

the holy Catholic Church,

the communion of saints,

the forgiveness of sins,

the resurrection of the body,

and life everlasting.

Amen.

THE NICENE CREED
We believe in One God,

the Father almighty, Creator of all things, visible and invisible,

and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son

of God, the first born of all creatures, born of the

Father before all ages, and not made, true God from

true God, consubstantial with his Father. Through

Him the worlds were formed and all things were created,

For the sake of us men and for our salvation

He came down from heaven; and became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and became man,

and was conceived and born of the Virgin Mary.

He suffered and was crucified in the days of Pontius Pilate

died and was buried; and on the third day rose again as it is written.

He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of his Father.

He will come again to judge the dead and the living.

We believe in one Holy Spirit; the spirit of truth,

who proceeds from the Father and the Son the life giving Spirit.

We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.

We confess one baptism for the remission of sins,

the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.

Amen.

thrust into hell Satan,

and all the evil spirits,

who prowl about the world

seeking the ruin of souls.

Amen.

COMPREHENSION
An example of comprehension type of question:


Read the following paragraphs and answer the questions below:


Holy Eucharist is the sacrament in which Jesus Christ gives his Body and Blood‚Äîhimself‚Äî for us, so that we too might give ourselves to him in love and be united with him in Holy Communion. In this way we are joined with the one Body of Christ, the Church. (Youcat answer 208, CCC 1322,1324,1409,1413). The Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life. The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it. For in the blessed  Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch. (CCC1324). The Eucharist is the sum and summary of our faith: ‚ÄúOur way of thinking is attuned to the Eucharist, and the Eucharist in turn confirms our way of thinking. (CCC 1327)

 

Someone who would like to receive Holy Eucharist must be Catholic. If he has a serious sin on his conscience, he must first make a confession. Before approaching the altar, one should be reconciled with his neighbors. (YOUCAT answer 220). To respond to the invitation to receive Holy Communion we must prepare ourselves for so great and so holy a moment. St. Paul urges us to examine our conscience: ‚ÄúWhoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself.‚Äù Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion. (CCC 1385). To prepare for worthy reception of this sacrament, the faithful should observe the fast required in their Church. Bodily demeanor (gestures, clothing) ought to convey the respect, solemnity, and joy of this moment when Christ becomes our guest. (CCC 1387)
